## About Foodtek

**Foodtek** is a food delivery app developed for a single restaurant. The project includes the complete backend implementation using Laravel. It supports core features such as user authentication, order and item management, payment processing, delivery tracking, reviews, and real-time notifications.

This application was fully developed by Shahed and Ahmed, who handled all the backend development including API creation and database design. It was built as part of a capstone project, with a strong focus on clean architecture and functional backend operations.

All API endpoints were developed and tested manually using Postman to ensure reliable and efficient request handling. The application is purely backend, with no frontend interface involved.

## Key Features

- User authentication (login, signup, logout via Laravel Breeze)
- Role and permission management
- Items and categories CRUD
- Orders and order items management
- Offers and discounts
- Payments (including delivery-specific cash tracking)
- Delivery tracking
- Reviews and favourites
- Address book for users
- Notifications
- Customer support (calls & chats)
- Issue reporting (suggestions/problems)

- Auth routes (login, register, logout)
- CRUD for items, categories, offers, reviews
- Order placement and tracking
- Delivery status updates
- Communication endpoints for chat/call simulation
- Favourites management
- Token validation (ensuring user tokens expire after logout or session timeout)
- Notification sending/receiving (ensuring notifications work for actions like order placement, delivery status)
- code validation (for discounts and offers)


##  API Modules

This project is modular and structured around:

- Authentication
- User & Roles
- Items, Categories
- Orders & Payments
- Reviews, Offers
- Addresses, Favourites
- Delivery System
